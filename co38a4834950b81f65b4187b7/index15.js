What is Babel ?
Babel is a transpiler i.e. it converts the JSX to vanilla JavaScript. 
You can view babel as an intermediate step between your code and "executable" code. 
React also uses ES6, which is not supported by most of the browsers. 
Babel converts the ES6 code to a code which is compatible with the browsers.
