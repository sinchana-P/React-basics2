/* Challenge:

EXTRA CREDIT:
Some jokes are only a punchline with no setup:

E.g.: "Itâ€™s hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because 
they always take things literally."

If you don't pass in a "question" prop, how might you make it only 
show the punchline?


SOlution:
 
<li>
    <Joke 
        punchline = "Itâ€™s hard to explain puns to kleptomaniacs because they always take things literally."
    />
</li>

NOTE :  Another Method


<div>
    <h3 style={{display: props.setup ? "block" : "none"}}>Setup: {props.setup}</h3>
    <p>Punchline: { props.punchline }</p>
</div>
